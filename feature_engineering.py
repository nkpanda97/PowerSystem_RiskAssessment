def plot_feature_properties(Input):
    """
    This function should do te following things:
        1. Print number of features, instances, and number of missing data per features
            A plot can be used to show number of missing features/ feature
        2. Plot the mean, variance and standard deviation of all features
        
        3. Plot the chi2 test score for all features and  
            sort it. Other appropiate tests can also be used.
        
        4. Plot corelation of various features and also show the features which have constant data

    Parameters
    ----------
    Input : Pandas dataframe
        Povided dataset

    Returns
    -------
    None.
